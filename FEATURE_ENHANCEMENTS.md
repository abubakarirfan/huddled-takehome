# Feature Enhancements

## Overview
Let's talk about how we can help users discover new artists in a way that's fun, engaging, and personalized.


## Enhancing User Discovery of New Artists

### Ideas to Help Users Discover New Artists
- **Figuring Out What Users Like**
  - Look at how often users come to the platform and what they do (like songs, share tracks, play them, etc.).
  - Pay attention to when users are most active—recommend artists during those times.
  - Check which artists users spend the most time on. If they’re looping tracks from a specific artist, that’s a big hint!
  - See what other users with similar tastes are into. If they like the same artists, chances are they’ll enjoy more of the same.
  - Mix it up! Suggest some fresh, lesser-known artists alongside their faves to keep things exciting.

### How We Could Build This
- **Collect the Right Data**
  - Expand the current data setup to log things like how long people listen, how they interact (like, share, etc.), and even genres.
- **Use Smart Recommendations**
  - Suggest artists based on what similar users like (collaborative filtering).
  - Recommend artists with similar styles or vibes to the user’s favorites (content-based filtering).
  - Combine both methods for a balanced approach.
- **Make It Seamless**
  - Add a “Recommended for You” section right under the graph on the dashboard.
  - Let users explore artists with a simple click—maybe show artist cards with quick-play buttons and links to profiles.
- **Keep It Fresh:**
  - Automatically update recommendations as users interact with the platform.
  - Show previews of new, trending, or underrated artists that match their preferences.

### Possible Hiccups and Fixes
- **Not Enough Data on New Users**
  - Use trending or popular artists as a backup for users who don’t have much activity yet.
- **Too Many Suggestions = Overload**
  - Keep the interface clean and focus on the top 3-5 recommendations.
- **Recommendations Too “Samey”**
  - Regularly throw in new artists or genres to keep it interesting.

### How We Know It’s Working

- Track how many users are checking out recommended artists and interacting with them (likes, shares, etc.).
- Keep an eye on session lengths—if people are staying longer and exploring, it’s a win.
- Add a quick “Did you like this recommendation?” thumbs-up or down button to get feedback.
- Test out different ways of recommending (e.g., show cards vs. just a list) and see what users respond to better.
